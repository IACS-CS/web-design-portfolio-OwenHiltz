          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
           I love go fishing and fly fishing. I am still a beginner at fly fishing but it is a lot fun. I like to go moutain biking and hiking also. In the winter time I go snowboarding.
           I also love working on my car, I have done oil changes, replaced and wired 4 new speakers, replaced spark plugs and igntion coils, suspension work, and replaced my brakes. I am starting to learn to sew too, I want to
           be able to make my own clothes and fix them too. I work at resturant in Andover as a prep cook and at a Farm Stand in Tewksbury called Farmer Dave's. I love both of my jobs but especially
           the cooking one because I make most of the food on the menu and even pizzas too.

          (Click on title to see project) I chose to do my CYOA project on a roadtrip. In this story you have many good and bad choices 
          that will either lead to the your airbnb or leave you stranded on the side of road.

        <p>
          (Click on title to see project) For this project we had to make business cards using the 
          box model and flex blocks. I did both of mine on trout fishing 
          guides. I would take a group of people fishing on a river
          for half days or full days.

        <p>
          (Click on title to see project) For my CSS Zen Garden I chose a Halloween theme because it was autumn when I made it.
           I made a background with chatgpt and it was some spooky pmupkins with a forest and a moon in the background. I made dropdown
            menus for the navigation bar and I made the text orange and black to fit the theme of Halloween. I also choose a spooky halloween font
            for my whole page.

          (Click on title to see project) For this project I made a interactive game about trying to be able to drive your car. In this 
          you have to find the right situation for the car to be able to drive. If you pick the wrong option you break down.

          (Click on title to see project) For this project I had to find a design, either a ad or like a website. I chose something 
          off of our school morning annoucments. After picking i had to redesign it to look and function better.
