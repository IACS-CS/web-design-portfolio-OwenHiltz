          <p>
           I love go fishing and fly fishing. I am still a beginner at fly fishing but it is a lot fun. I like to go moutain biking and hiking also. In the winter time I go snowboarding.
           I also love working on my car, I have done oil changes, replaced and wired 4 new speakers, and replaced spark plugs and igntion coils. I am starting to learn to sew too, I want to
           be able to make my own clothes and fix my own. I work at resturant in Andover as a prep cook and at a Farm Stand in Tewksbury called Farmer Dave's. I love both of my jobs but especially
           the cooking one because I make most of the food on the menu and even pizzas too.

          (Click on title to see project) I chose to do my CYOA project on a roadtrip. In this story you have many good and bad choices 
          that will either lead to the your airbnb or leave you stranded on the side of road.

        <p>
          (Click on title to see project) For this project we had to make business cards using the 
          box model and flex blocks. I did both of mine on trout fishing 
          guides. I would take a group of people fishing on a river
          for half days or full days.
